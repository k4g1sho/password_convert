#Problem statement
Replaced firefox with falkon due to 4GB ram limit. On my kubuntu laptop. I had to copy password from firefox to Falkon which used very little ram. Firefox exports passwords in csv file, Falkon imports passwords in xml. Using online converters is a security nightmare. After analysing the firefox csv and Falkons xml. This code was made.

##password_convert
Read firefox csv password data and create password xml file for Falkon
